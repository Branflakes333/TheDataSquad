# Abstract

This study aims to analyze and compare housing markets between selected cities in the United States and London. Using data from Zillow for U.S. housing and Kaggle for London housing prices, the analysis seeks to identify similarities in housing trends and factors affecting home prices across these regions. Methodologies include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and t-tests to determine patterns and significant differences in pricing factors. The study will utilize statistical programming in Python and R, employing libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels` for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical testing. Preliminary findings suggest potential price clustering and factor differentiation between the two regions, providing insight into how global and regional economic factors impact housing affordability.

# I. Introduction

* **Background & Motivation**  
  * Overview of current housing market trends in the U.S.  
  * Importance of comparing U.S. markets with a major international city, London, for a broader understanding of housing dynamics.  
* **Research Questions**  
  * Which U.S. cities have similar housing market characteristics to London?  
  * Are there notable differences between U.S. and London housing markets in terms of average price and influencing factors such as size and location?  
* **Hypotheses**  
  * **Hypothesis 1:** Home prices in London are generally higher than those in the U.S.  
  * **Hypothesis 2:** Significant differences exist between U.S. and London housing markets due to distinct economic and geographic factors.  
* **Scope & Limitations**  
  * Limitations in currency conversions and data timeliness across regions.  
  * Challenges in matching comparable market indicators between datasets.
