```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

US = read.csv("../data/raw/City_zhvi_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month.csv")
london = read.csv("../data/raw/london.csv")
```

 ### London Dataset

```{r overview}
names(london)
head(london)
```

Price is in Pounds, and therefore needs to be converted to USD. Will assume prices are from 2020

```{r price_conversion}
conversion2020 = 1.28 # 1 pound = $1.28

london$Price = london$Price * conversion2020
```


Save processed dataset
```{r save_london}
write.csv(x = london, file = "../data/processed/london_processed.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
